Database
	- collection of related data
	- allows for the preservation of data past the lifetime of an application

DBMS
	- Database management systems
		- collections of applications used to create and maintain databases
			- store data in a structured format
			- allows for concurrent use of data
			- control the access of data
			- maintain data integrity
			- data back up and recovery
	- RDBMS
		- Relational Database Management Systens
			- consists of a collection of tables where tables are connected and reference each other
				- Table
					- rows
						- particular instance of a data category
							- records, data entities
					- columns
						- category of data/fields
SQL
	- Structured Query Language
		- provides a way to interact with data entities
	- SQL implementations
		- different "flavors" of SQL, arising the different vendors and platforms available
			- ie: PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, MySQL
			- syntax may vary based on the implementation
				- we're going to be working with PostgreSQL
important distinction
	- PostgreSQL is the RDBMS
	- DBeaver is a tool used to visualize and interact with database entities
		- IS NOT A DATABASE

Database schema is a collection of tables, views, trigger, functions...
	- all belong to one database
		- a database may have multiple schema

PostgreSQL
	- free and opensource
	- Datatypes - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatype.html
		- Character types
			- CHAR
				- fixed-length, blank padded
			- VARCHAR
				- variable length, with a limit
			- TEXT
				- variable length, with no limit
		- Numeric types
			- INTEGER
			- DECIMAL
				- for floating point values, user specified
		- Temporal types
			- DATE
			- TIME
			- TIMESTAMP
				- date and time
		- Autoincrementing integer
			- SERIAL

SQL Sublanguages
	- refers to the different types of operations to be performed on database entities
	- for the sake of this training there are 5 SQL sublanguages
		- DDL, DCL, DML, DQL, TCL

DDL
	- Data Definition Language
	- Statements that are used to construct/edit/delete database/schema/users/tables/properties (data entities)
		- CREATE
		- ALTER
		- DROP
		- TRUNCATE
			- unlike DROP, removes all of the records in a table

Keys
	- primary keys
		- a column or combination of columns which acts as a unique identifier to a record in a table
			- composite keys
				- combination of columns which act as the primary key
			- UNIQUE and NOT NULL
	- foreign keys
		- used to illustrate relations between records
			- "point"/"reference" a record in another table
	- candidate keys
		- any columns that could be a primary key

Constraints
	- limit the type of data entered in tables to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the ata
		- primary key
			- not null and unique
		- unique, column's value needs to be unique
		- not null, column value cannot be null
		- check(condition)
			- ensurs that the condition is met
		- references
			- foreign key relationships
