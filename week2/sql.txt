Database
	- collection of related data
	- allows for the preservation of data past the lifetime of an application

DBMS
	- Database management systems
		- collections of applications used to create and maintain databases
			- store data in a structured format
			- allows for concurrent use of data
			- control the access of data
			- maintain data integrity
			- data back up and recovery
	- RDBMS
		- Relational Database Management Systens
			- consists of a collection of tables where tables are connected and reference each other
				- Table
					- rows
						- particular instance of a data category
							- records, data entities
					- columns
						- category of data/fields
SQL
	- Structured Query Language
		- provides a way to interact with data entities
	- SQL implementations
		- different "flavors" of SQL, arising the different vendors and platforms available
			- ie: PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, MySQL
			- syntax may vary based on the implementation
				- we're going to be working with PostgreSQL
important distinction
	- PostgreSQL is the RDBMS
	- DBeaver is a tool used to visualize and interact with database entities
		- IS NOT A DATABASE

Database schema is a collection of tables, views, trigger, functions...
	- all belong to one database
		- a database may have multiple schema

PostgreSQL
	- free and opensource
	- Datatypes - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatype.html
		- Character types
			- CHAR
				- fixed-length, blank padded
			- VARCHAR
				- variable length, with a limit
			- TEXT
				- variable length, with no limit
		- Numeric types
			- INTEGER
			- DECIMAL
				- for floating point values, user specified
		- Temporal types
			- DATE
			- TIME
			- TIMESTAMP
				- date and time
		- Autoincrementing integer
			- SERIAL

SQL Sublanguages
	- refers to the different types of operations to be performed on database entities
	- for the sake of this training there are 5 SQL sublanguages
		- DDL, DCL, DML, DQL, TCL

DDL
	- Data Definition Language
	- Statements that are used to construct/edit/delete database/schema/users/tables/properties (data entities)
		- CREATE
		- ALTER
		- DROP
		- TRUNCATE
			- unlike DROP, removes all of the records in a table

Keys
	- primary keys
		- a column or combination of columns which acts as a unique identifier to a record in a table
			- composite keys
				- combination of columns which act as the primary key
			- UNIQUE and NOT NULL
	- foreign keys
		- used to illustrate relations between records
			- "point"/"reference" a record in another table
	- candidate keys
		- any columns that could be a primary key

Constraints
	- limit the type of data entered in tables to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the ata
		- primary key
			- not null and unique
		- unique, column's value needs to be unique
		- not null, column value cannot be null
		- check(condition)
			- ensurs that the condition is met
		- references
			- foreign key relationships

Domain integrity
	- values must fall within the constraints placed on the columns
	- make sure that the values are correct in order to support the business logic
	
Referential integrity
	- want the database to be working properly within the constraints of a foreign key relationship
	- don't want records to reference another record that no longer exists
		- orphaned record
	- delete on cascade
		- deletes the record and records referencing it as well

Multiplicity
	- refers to relationships between tables
		- one-to-one
			- exactly one row references another row in another table
			- ie: SSN per individual
		- one-to-many/ many to one
			- exactly one row in a table is referenced by potentially many rows in another table
			- ie: one team has many players but each player has only one team
		- many-to-many
			- several rows can be references by several rows in another table
				- ie: users can have many friends
			- junction table
				- table that has a primary key which is a composite key of foreign key


DCL
	- Data Control Language
	- managing user permissions within a database
		- GRANT and REVOKE to define power/access to schema/tables to users

DML
	- Data Manipulation Language
	- statements used to perform record level operation
		- to interact with records within tables
	- CRUD
		- create/read/update/delete
	- INSERT
		- create operation
		- insert into [table_name] ([col1_name], [col2_name],...) values ([col1_value], [col2_value],...);
			- ez way to generate data:
				- https://www.mockaroo.com/
	- UPDATE
		- update [table_name] set [col1_name] = [col1_value] where [condition];
			- if no where clause is specified, it will update every record in the table
	- DELETE
		- delete from [table_name] where [condition];
			- if no where clause is specified, it will delete every record in the table

DQL
	- Data Query Language
		- "sub-sub" language/ part of DML
	- Statements used to retrieve information from tables
	- SELECT
		- main operation that is used when querying data
			- can use addition clause to filter much much further
		- where
		- group by
		- having (kind of like the where clause after aggregation)
		- order by
		- limit


Joins
	- way to combine rows from different tables based on some logical relationship (columns) 
		- inner join/ join: returns all the records that have matching values in both tables
		- left(outer) join: return all records from the left table and matching records from the right table
		- right(outer) join: return all records from the right table and matching records from the left table
		- full(outer) join: returns all records whether there is a match or not from both tables 
		- self join: join a table with itself to combine related data on the same table

	- Join documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-join.html


TCL
	- Transaction Control Language
		- Transaction consists in combining multiple database operations into one unit of work
			- (PostgreSQL treats every SQL statement as being executed within a transaction unless specified otherwise)
	- Relevant statements
		- begin
			- can indicate the start of a transaction
				- if begin is not used, one can be provided implicitely
			- put the statement(s) to be executed as one unit work
			- between begin and commit
		- savepoint
			- saves the state of the database at a certain point within the transaction
		- rollback
			- reverts the state of a database to a previous commit or savepoint
		- commit
			- saves/persist changes to a database

	- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-transactions.html
	- Properties of a transaction - ACID
		- Atomicity
			- one unit, transaction should be completed as a whole or not at all
		- Consistency
			- database should be in a valid state before/after the transaction
				- valid in regards to the database constraints
				- valid in regards to the business logic
		- Isolation
			- a transaction should not interfere with another transaction
			- results of a transactions executing concurrently should be the same as if they occured in sequence
		- Durability
			- Commits are final, changes should be persisted to the database

	- Transaction Isolation Levels
		- Read uncommited
			- able to read/interact with uncommited
		- Read committed
			- only able to interact with commited data
		- Repeatable read
			- only see data that has been committed before the transaction began
		- Serializable
			- strictest level of isolation
			- making transactions happen one after another
	- Read phenomena
		- Dirty read (arises from read uncommitted isolation level)
			- transaction is able to read data written in a concurrent uncommitted transaction
		- Non repeatable read
			- transaction re-reads data that it has previously read and finds that the data has been modified by another transaction
		- Phantom read
			- transaction re-execute a query an returns a set of row to find out that the set has been modified by another transaction
