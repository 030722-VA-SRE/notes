JDBC
	- Java Database Connectivity
		- establish a connection between a java application and a database
			- dependency needed is database specific
	- Important JDBC classes/ interfaces
		- DriverManager (C)
			- manages the JDBC driver
			- .getConnection() method
				- provide a connection to the database using url, username, password
					- hardcoded (bad practice)
					- property file (prevent credential leak by adding file to gitignore)
					- environment variables
		- Connection (I)
			- represents the connection to your database
			- createStatement()/PreparedStatement()
			- close()
		- Statement (I)
			- represents a SQL statement
			- .executeQuery()
				- vulnerable to SQL injection
		- PreparedStatement (I)
			- represents a SQL statement
				- that has been preprocessed and prevents SQL injection
			- use methods to set fields
		- ResultSet (I)
			- represents the result of a query
	- SQL injection
		- placing malicious code into a sql statement
			- ie: username = "0; DROP TABLE X;"

DAO
	- Data Access Object
		- design pattern
			- programming best practice to address common programming "issues"/"problems"
		- used to address decoupling Java object persistence into a specific class
