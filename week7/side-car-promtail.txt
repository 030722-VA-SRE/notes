Promtail sidecar
	- https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/installation/
	- promtail is an agent in charge of sending application logs to Loki
		- currently we have a Promtail instance running as a daemonset for the cluster which captures all syslogs
			- since this is cluster wide for all p2s the configuration is kept broad
		- to send log files to Loki and customize labels/log entries, for this project use promtail as a sidecar for your application
			- meaning that a promtail container is going to run on the same pod as your application
				- the two containers can share a volume for the logs
				- Promtail can send them to Loki based on some configuration

	- What is needed
		- adding Promtail to the application deployment
		- a Config Map to pass in promtail.yml (configuration for promtail)
		- a volume to share the logs between application and promtail
			- regular volume is fine here
		- an external service for Loki
			- by default, pods communicate with pods within the same namespace
				- since Loki is running on the default namespace, an external service will be used to send data to it
	- Useful debug commands
		- kubectl describe
		- kubectl logs [podname] [containername] [namespace]
		- kubectl exec -it -n [namespace] [podname] -c [containername] -- bash
			- to navigate the container's file system
