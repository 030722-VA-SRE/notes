## Inline and Block Elements
 
Before listing all the HTML elements available to use, it's important to know the difference between inline and block-level elements.

Block-level elements are those that will render on new lines in blocks by default, instead of rendering within the line itself like inline elements do. 

One example of a block element is <div>, and a common inline element is <span>. Try them out on your webpage and notice the difference.
