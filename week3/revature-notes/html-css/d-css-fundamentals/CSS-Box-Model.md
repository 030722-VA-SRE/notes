# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model used to determine how our web page is rendered by browser. It considers each element on the page as a box, CSS allows you to apply different properties that define where and how that element appears. Web pages are made up of rectangular boxes arranged and related to each other.

Every box has 4 parts - **margin**, **border**, **padding** and **content**. The margin is an outermost box,  inside that the border, then padding, then the content is innermost. All box sizes/formatting can be styled with CSS.

**Margin**  -   It is a space between border and margin. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors. The dimensions are given by the margin-box width and the margin-box height. 

**Border** -  It is the area between the boxâ€™s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.

**Padding** -  It is a space around the content area and within the border-box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.

**Content** -  It consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content-box width and height.
