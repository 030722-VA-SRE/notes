# Overview of CSS

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** - it is a language for styling HTML documents by specifying certain rules for layout and display in key/value pairs. Style Sheets are a simple and powerful method of allowing attachment of rendering information to HTML documents. It used to style the webpages by setting background-color, font color, font size, font family, etc.

A CSS consists of a *set of rules* that defines the styles for a web page. A CSS style rule composed of **selectors** and **declarations**. The selector is an HTML Element *like h3 used in the below example*. The declaration is comprised of a property and a value surrounded by curly braces. In the below example font-family, font-style and color were properties of the selector h3. Arial, italic and red were the values assigned, respectively, to the properties.

*Example:*
 ```  
    h3 { 
        font-family: Arial; 
        font-style: italic; 
        color: red 
        }
```
