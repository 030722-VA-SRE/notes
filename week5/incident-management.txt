Incident Management
	- process of handling an incident once an alert has been triggered by the monitoring system
		- SRE on call is in charge of starting process if needed
			- not every alert has to trigger it
				- some alerts may have a playbook highlighting how to handle the issue
					- good candidate for automation (reducing toil)
				- at the SRE's discretion
					- is serious (ie: bleeding out money)
						- start process right away
					- is less serious
						- don't start right away, unless no progress is made in x amount of time
			- on call is a rotation usually 1 out of 6-8 weeks
				- "have the pager"
			- requires a time response
				- business critical
					- within 5 minutes
				- urgent
					- within 30 minutes
	- once the process has been initiated other teams might be required to participate
		- ie: devs to understand a recent change made
	- To optimize the resolution of the incident, a clear process and chain of command is recommended
		- 3 roles
			- Incident Commander (IC)
				- owns incident
					- responsible for making decisions regarding the resolution of the incident
				- might be the SRE on call, or it might be another SRE so that the SRE on call can continue the investigation as the Ops lead
				- appoints a CL
			- Ops Lead (OL)
				- owns the investigation
				- can add more investigators as needed
					- communication channel
						- ie: slack
						- updates can be posted
						- metrics/monitoring data
			- Communications Lead (CL)
				- keep people informed
					- keeps stakeholders updated while investigators can focus on the problem
				- start an incident document
					- shared with the team to be kept up to date
					- maintains the incident document as updates are given
					- once the incident is over, the incident document becomes the basis for a postmortem
			- roles can easily be transfered when shifts end thanks to the incident document

Postmortem
	- document based on the incident document that describes what happened and how it was resolved
		- root cause of the incident
		- how to address the underlying issues
	- drafted by the SRE team involved in the incident
		- reviewed and published for anyone to read it
	- part of continuous improvement culture
		- learning opportunity to prevent similar incidents in the future
		- blame free
			- constructive criticism
	- general template
		- date/people involved
		- executive summary
			- ~1 sentence summary of what happened and the impact
		- problem summary
			- technical issue
			- root cause
		- action items
			- link them to a backlog/product backlog to be iterated on
		- lesson learned
			- what went well
			- what could be improved on
		- timeline
			- highlights the step taken to recovery
	- get feedback from other SRE practices
		- does the system have good monitoring?
			- do we need more/different metrics?
		- does something need to be automated?
