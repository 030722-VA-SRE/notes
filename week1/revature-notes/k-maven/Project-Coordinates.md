## Maven Project Coordinates

Maven Project coordinates identify uniquely a project, a dependency, or a plugins defined in the `pom.xml` file - these are:
* `group-id` - The group, company, team, organization, project, or other group. for example: "com.revature"
* `artifact-id` - A unique identifier under `groupId` that represents a single project. for example: "myproject"
* `version` - A specific release of a project. Projects that have been released have a fixed version identifier that refers to a specific version of the project. Projects undergoing active development can use a special identifier that marks a version as a `SNAPSHOT`. for example: "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
* `packaging`- The type of project, defaulting to `jar`, describing the packaged output produced by a project. A project with packaging `jar` produces a JAR archive; a project with packaging `war` produces a web application.
