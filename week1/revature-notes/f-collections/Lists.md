## List Interface
A `List` is a collection that is ordered and preserves the order in which elements are inserted into the list. Contrary to sets, duplicate entries are allowed. Also, elements are accessed by their index, which begins with 0 for the first element in the list.

### Vector
`Vector` is an older class which implements `List` - it is essentially a thread-safe implementation of an `ArrayList`.

### Stack
`Stack` is an older implementation of the stack data structure (last-in-first-out, or LIFO). Generally you should use an `ArrayDeque` for implementing a stack.
