### Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, compiled, strongly typed object-oriended programming (OOP) language. The advantages of Java are many: it is platform independent, has a C-language inspired syntax, provides automatic memory management, has an extensive built-in runtime library, is supported by the Oracle corporation, and has a rich open source community.

When we say Java is *object-oriented*, we mean that it has the constructs of **classes** and **objects** built into the language. It also allows us to use various principles of object-oriented programming, which are covered in a separate module. An object in code can represent a real-world entity, or a conceptual entity. Classes are the *blueprints* for how to create objects that contain  a certain **state** - which is represented by *fields* (variables) - and **behavior** - which is defined via *methods*. Objects are instances of class definitions. However, Java is not 100% object-oriented because it still has [**primitive values**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) (or just: primitives), which are defined below:

| Primitive type | Size | Description |
| -------------- | ---- | ----------- |
|`boolean` | not specified (JVM-dependent) | represents true and false values |
|`byte` | 8-bit | numerical, integral value |
|`short` | 16-bit | signed numerical, integral value |
|`char` | 16-bit | unsigned numerical, Unicode character |
|`int` | 32-bit | numerical, integral value |
|`long` | 64-bit | numerical, integral value |
|`float` | 32-bit | floating point value |
|`double` | 64-bit | floating point value |
