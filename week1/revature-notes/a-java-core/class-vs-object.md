## Class vs Object

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for how to create an object. We instantiate objects from their class using a constructor.

| Class  | Object |
| ------ | ------ |
| Class is declared using `class` keyword. For example,`class Student{}` | Object is created through `new` keyword. For example, `Student s1=new Student();`|
| Class is declared once.	| Object is created many times as per requirement. |
| Class doesn't allocated memory when it is created. |	Object allocates memory when it is created. |
