Java
	- Object based Programming Language (OOP)
		- multi paradigm language
			- also supports different programming paradigms such as functional programming
	- Backed/maintained by Oracle, mature language
		- updates/maintained
		- a lot of documentations, tutorials, resources overall
			- StackOverflow (chances are someone ran into your issue before)
	- Portable/Platform independent
		- WORA - write once run anywhere
		- due to the JVM
	- Compiled language
		- compile time error checking
		- compiles java source code into an intermediary language (bytecode) to be run by the JVM
	- Support multithreading
		- run processes concurrently
	- Automatic garbage collection
		- no need to manually allocate/deallocate memory
			- garbage collector
	- Strictly typed

JDK/JRE/JVM
	- JDK
		- Java Development Kit
			- Provides an environment to develop and execute a Java Program
			- Contains the compiler, tools for development
			- Contains the JRE and JVM
	- JRE
		- Java Runtime Environment
			- All that's needed to RUN an application
			- Contains the JVM
			- Contains the core libraries for Java
	- JVM
		- Java Virtual Machine
			- Takes the COMPILED code (bytecode) and executes it from the main method
			- Different OS can have different implementation of the JVM

Compilation process
	highlevel code (Java Source code) => javac [.java filename] => Bytecode (intermediary language) (.class file)
Running Java
	Bytecode (intermediary language) (.class file) => java [.class filename])
Can pass in arguments:
	java [.class file name] [args0] [args1] ...
