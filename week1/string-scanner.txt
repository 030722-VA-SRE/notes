Strings
	- String is a class, therefore we have String objects
		- arrays of characters
	- immutable: the value of strings cannot be changed
	- Strings are usually stored in the String pool (which is in the heap)
		- this allows Java to reuse the same String object for repeated instances
			- String s = "s"; // String Pool
			- String s = new String("s"); // stored in the heap and not the string pool
		- .intern() - checks if a string is already in the String pool if yes returns a reference to it, otherwise adds to the string pool then returns the reference

StringBuilder/StringBuffers
	- mutable alternatives to Strings with methods that allow for manipulation
	- StringBuffer - ThreadSafe, slower
	- StringBuilder - not threadsafe, faster

Scanner
	- Class in java that can be used to capture user input via the console
		- files, input streams
	- can parse for different types, read a line....
	- Recommendation: use one scanner per input stream (ie: System.in)
	- Good practice is to close resources to avoid memory leaks
