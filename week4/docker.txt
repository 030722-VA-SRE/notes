Docker
	- Tool that revolves around the idea of containerization
		- used to develop and deploy applications using containers
	- supported on Linux
		- Toolbox required for other OS
	- follows a Client Server Architecture

Container
	- Standardized unit of software
	- Abstraction at the app layer that packages the code and dependencies together
		- multiple containers can run on the same Docker engine and share the same OS with one another
			- lightweight and scalable
			- each container runs as an isolated process
			- more efficient use of resources
		- CONTAINERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM VIRTUAL MACHINES

Terminology
	- Docker Daemon
		- background service running on the OS that manages building and running Docker containers
		- interacted with using the docker client
	- Docker Client
		- commandline tool used to interact with the Docker daemon
	- Dockerfile
		- a simple text file that contains a list of commands to create a docker image
			- note: a dockerfile does not have a file extension
			- FROM [base-image]
				- image to be built upon/usually runtime environment for an application
	- Docker Image
		- blueprint of an application to create a container
		- includes everything needed to run an application, the artifact, the runtime, dependencies..
	- Docker Container
		- a running process, isolated from the host and each other
		- each container interacts with its own filesystem provided by the docker image
