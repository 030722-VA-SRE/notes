Docker
	- Tool that revolves around the idea of containerization
		- used to develop and deploy applications using containers
	- supported on Linux
		- Toolbox required for other OS
	- follows a Client Server Architecture

Container
	- Standardized unit of software
	- Abstraction at the app layer that packages the code and dependencies together
		- multiple containers can run on the same Docker engine and share the same OS with one another
			- lightweight and scalable
			- each container runs as an isolated process
			- more efficient use of resources
		- CONTAINERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM VIRTUAL MACHINES

Terminology
	- Docker Daemon
		- background service running on the OS that manages building and running Docker containers
		- interacted with using the docker client
	- Docker Client
		- commandline tool used to interact with the Docker daemon
	- Dockerfile - https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from
		- a simple text file that contains a list of commands to create a docker image
			- note: a dockerfile does not have a file extension
			- FROM [base-image]
				- image to be built upon/usually runtime environment for an application
			- ADD [url]
				- to add a file from online to a container
			- COPY [Host Filesystem] [container's filesystem]
				- use to copy and rename(if desired) files to a container
			- ENV
				- used to specify environment variable
					- can also specify env var at runtime using docker run -e
			- CMD/RUN
				- run commands like sudo yum update...
			- ENTRYPOINT
				- used to specify the entrypoint of the application
			- EXPOSE
				- specifies what port to expose
	- Docker Image
		- blueprint of an application to create a container
		- includes everything needed to run an application, the artifact, the runtime, dependencies..
	- Docker Container
		- a running process, isolated from the host and each other
		- each container interacts with its own filesystem provided by the docker image
	- Docker volume
		- preferred way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers
		- can be shared by containers

Docker Workflow
	- Dockerfile -> docker build -t [image-name] . -> Docker Image -> docker run -p [host-port]:[container-port] -d (detached mode) [image-name] -> Docker Container

Basic docker commands:
	- docker
		- displays a list of available commands
	- docker ps
		- displays running containers
		- -a for all containers
	- docker images
		- displays a list of available images
	- docker build
	- docker run
	- docker stop
	- docker kill
	- docker logs

Dockerhub
	- online registry and version control system of docker images
		- docker pull
		- docker push
