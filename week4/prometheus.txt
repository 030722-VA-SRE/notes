Spring Boot actuator
	- provides metrics about the application
in application.yml:
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, metrics, prometheus

Micrometer
	- provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems
		- allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in
			- Think SLF4J, but for application metrics! 
	- Application metrics recorded by Micrometer are intended to be used to observe, alert, and react to the current/recent operational state of your environment

Prometheus
	- is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. 
	- collects and stores its metrics as time series data, 
		- i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels

	- features
		- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
		- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
		- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
			- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
		- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
		- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support
	- architecture
