Updating deployments
	- by default Kubernetes leverages a RollingUpdate strategy
		- maxUnavailable
			- maximum number/percentage of pods unavailable
		- maxSurge
			- maximum number/percentage of pods over the number of replicas specified
	- kubernetes keeps old replica sets (ie: for previous versions) for ease of rolling back
	- can also specify
		- minReadySeconds
			- how long for a pod to be considered "ready"
	- to rollout an update
		- kubectl apply -f [updated-deployment-file].yml
	- to watch in real time
		- kubectl get pods --watch
	- status
		- kubectl rollout status deployment [deployment-name]
	- rollback
		- kubectl rollout undo deployment [deployment-name] 

DevOps
	- in traditional models the development team and the operations teams have separate responsibilities and goals
		- can cause frictions between the teams
			- dev team wants more features/rapid change, high velocity
			- ops team prefer a static production environment to reduce the chances of dropping the availability of the application
				- new releases can be a major cause of dropping the availability of the app
	- set of practices that combines software development with IT operations
		- goal is to create "high quality code" more efficiently 

DevOps practices
	- Continuous Integration (CI)
		- practice of consistently merging source code, often in a centralized location/repository
			- prevent large error from accumulating
			- to make sure that people are working on the latest codebase
	- Continuous Delivery (CD)
		- Automating the process of preparing for deployment
			- each commit/pushes/merge will be tested and prepared for deployment
			- Having the application in a constant state of being ready to be deployed "at the push of a button"
				- requires human intervention for last step
	- Continuous Deployment (CD)
		- once code is integrated and passes every stages of the continuous delivery pipeline, releases/deploys to production
			- without the button
			- does not need human intervention
		- can lead to issues being introduced to the production system
			- benefits: rapid iteration, more immediate feedback to changes
			- SLOs are not 100%
				- as long as SLO are met, no worries
				- otherwise might need to pause releases and quickly rollback

DevOps Pipeline
	- set of automated processes and tools that allow developers and operators to collaborate in building and deploying code
		- build, test, deploy, maintain software
	- series of steps to achieve continuous delivery/deployment
		- for continuous delivery
			- testing, code quality analysis,...
			- at the end of the pipeline, a final (simple) action is needed to deploy the application
				- saying yes/no
		- for continuous deployment
			- should be able to abort if needed, but in general does not require human interaction
